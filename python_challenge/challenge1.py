# 1a. what are the main features of python
# ans:
# 1. Python is easy to code, It is a high level programming language yet, it is effortless to learn
# It is easy to read : Python code looks like simple english words
# It is  free and open source, it supports cross-platform
# Python has Robust standard library
# Python is dynamically typed , that is it does not associate a type to a variable until runtime
# white space is used to denote blocks in python unlike other programming language that uses curly braces
# Python is interpreted which means your program source code is converted to bytecode and executed line by line
# which is then interpreted by Python virtual machine
# Python virtual machine executes the python byte-codes
# Python is object-oriented
# Python is portable i.e the same code can be used on differrent machines


# 1b. What are the Zens of python:
# ans:
# Beautiful is better than ugly
# Explicit is better than implicit
# Simple is better than complex
# Complex is better than complicated
# Readability counts

# 2. what is the difference between a list and a dictionary in python
# ans:
# A list is a variable that can store multiple values or items  example
# language = ["Python", "Java", "JavaScript"].
# we use square bracket to declare list in python
# while a dictionary is a collection of key-value pair elements.
# Dictionary elements are created in a curly bracket example
# Vehicle = {
#   "type": "car",
#   "wheel": 4
#   "can_move": True
#   }

# 3. In your words explain the keyword pass
# ans:
# Pass keyword is a null statement . It is used as a placeholder for future code, also when an empty code is declared we use
# the pass keyword for nothing to happen and to prevent getting an error message

# 4. What is iterator in Python
# ans:
#An iterator in Python is an object that contains a countable number of elements that can be iterated upon.

# 5. what is unit testing
# unit testing is testing a unit of code in an application to ensure that it works as expected .
# It is a process in software engineering in which most of the smallest and most testable part
# of an application is individually tested to ensure it satisfies their use case

# 6. Of the available unit testing framework in python which is your favourite and why
# ans:
# unittest is my favorite unit testing framework because it is easier for me to organise
# my test suite with unit test and  unittest is quite easy for me.

# 7. Name the types of arguments in python
# ans:
# arguments are the values sent to your function: we have 5 types of Arguments in python
# Required arguments, Default arguments, Keyword arguments,
# Arbitrary arguments, Arbitrary Keyword arguments

# 8. Explain what functions are
# ans:
# A function is a reusable block of code that is executed
# when it is called(invoked) from other part of the program. Functions are created with def keyword

# 9. How do you create a class in python
# ans:
# you create a class by using the syntax: class followed by class_name:
# class animal:

# 10. Explain what polymorphism and inheritance is in python OOP
# ans:
# inheritance is an OOP capability that allows a class to derive or inherit attributes and methods
# from another class. the class that derived property is called the Derived class or child class
# while the class from which the property was derived is called the parent class
# polymorphism is an OOP capability that  allows a method to perform many functions or logic
